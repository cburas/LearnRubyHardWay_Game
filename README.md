# LearnRubyHardWay_Game
my game for exercise 45 of Zed Shaw's "Learning Ruby the Hard Way." He says to do a room game like the two he has already done but that wouldn't have taken much thought. And I was bored with that.

I decided I wanted on a matching game using hashes. I'm also required to create classes which I figured would be the questions. I'm also supposed to require another file. I haven't figured how to incorporate that yet since he hasn't in any of his past exercises, except to write things in a blank one.
